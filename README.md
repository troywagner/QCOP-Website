QCOP-Website
============

qcop.ca

If there is a interim site there, go to qcop.ca/dev/


Originally a private repo on my bitbucket. I decided that there was nothing that couldnt be open source. The registration will not be here and if it is, there will be missing codes. Everything else is just information.

Contributors:

Keith Weaver - Developed.

Hamy Nguyen - Graphics.
